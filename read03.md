## 1. Wireframe and Design:
**Wireframes** give designers the first real chance to visualize a website hierarchy and user interface and give customers a valuable first look at how their website will be designed. Teams use wireframes to design a design and criticise its response to testers. **Ideas that sound great on paper do not always translate to the screen, and wireframes can be helpful in identifying these kinds of problems early in the design process.**

Even if creative design elements are not included in the wireframe, it is *easy for designers* and customers to focus on elements, hierarchies and structures that affect the user experience at startup or later.
#### Examples of wireframe:

2. Mozilla HTML Basics
**HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)** is the language and code used to **structure a website and its content**. The output tree is a parse tree, a tree of DOM elements with attributes for each node. It is the subject of the presentation of the HTML document and the interface between HTML elements and the outside world *(JavaScript)*.

Each element starts with an **opening tag** consisting of the name of the element. Similar to the opening pendant, the closing pendant is wrapped in brackets for opening and closing. One of **the *most common* tags in HTML** is a and other elements can be nested in it such as **img >, strong > and em >.**

3. Semantics
One of the **most important** developments of HTML5 was the introduction of a standardized set of **semantic elements**. The term **semantic refers to the meaning of words and things**, and a semantic element is an element designed to characterize the structure of a document *meaningfully* so it becomes **clear what its purpose is and what it serves the document**.


#### Example of Semantics HTML:



* < article >
* < aside >
* < details >
* < figcaption >
* < figure >
* < footer >
* < header >
* < main >
* < mark >
* < nav >
* < section >
* < summary>
* < time >

3. Mozilla HTML Docs
HTML elements are labels for content such as **headings, paragraphs, links, etc. An HTML element is a set of other texts within a document** *and* **each tag consists of an element with a surrounding name. For example, the title sign says "title" instead of "title" or vice versa.**
