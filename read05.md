### Operators

In JS we have 10 types of Operators, and I will discuss them as follows:

**1. Assignment Operators**

and the simplest one is the " = "  and in JS we assign a value for a variable. this value could be a number, String, another variable, calculation, and so on.

Here is some **Example:**
- ``` var x = 1 ```
- ``` var y += x ```
- ``` var j = 1+2 ```


**2. Comparison Operators**

This type of Operators is compares operands  and returns the logical value based on whether the Comparison is true, the type od operands could be a numbers, String, logical, and objects values. we use some notation as **( ==, != === , !== , > , >= , <, <=)**

Here is some **Example**

- ``` 
x = 3
    if(x == 3){ // means Equal
      // it will returns true
    }
``` 


- ``` 
x = 3
    if(x != 3){ // means not Equal
      // it will returns false
    }
```


- ``` 
x = 3
    if(x >= 4){ // means if it Equal or greater than
      // it will returns true
    }
```


**3. Arithmetic Operators**
