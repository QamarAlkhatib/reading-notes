# Mongo and Mongoose

1. Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

|   SQL |    |  NoSQL|
|------ |------ |------ |
|SQL databases are relational |    |  NoSQL databases are non-relational  |
|use structured query language and have a predefined schema    |    | NoSQL databases have dynamic schemas for unstructured data   |
|vertically scalable    |    | horizontally scalable   |
|table-based    |    | document, key-value, graph, or wide-column stores   |
|better for multi-row transactions    |    | better for unstructured data like documents or JSON   |

2. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
    * complex query intensive environment.

3. What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
    * hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data.

4. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

    * NOSQL/

5. Which type of database is best for scalability?
    * In SQL You can manage increasing load by increasing the CPU, RAM, SSD, etc, on a single server.

    * In NOSQL  You can just add few more servers easily in your NoSQL database infrastructure to handle the large traffic.
