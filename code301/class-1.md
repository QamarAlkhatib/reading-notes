# Readings: Introduction to React and Components

## Component Based Architecture
----
### What is a component?

A component is a well-defined set of modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable functionality that encapsulates and exports its implementation as a higher-level interface. A component is a software object that encapsulates specific functionality or a group of functionalities and is designed to interact with other components. It has a clearly defined interface and follows a specified behavior that other components in an architecture should follow.

-----
### What are the charactistics of a component?

* Reusability: Components are typically designed to be reused in a variety of contexts and applications.
Some components, on the other hand, may be designed for a specific duty.

* Replaceable: Components that are replaceable may be freely substituted with other similar components.

* Not context specific: Components are built to work in a variety of situations and contexts. 

* Extensible:  A component's behavior can be extended by combining it with that of other components.


* Encapsulated: an encapsulated an encapsulated an encapsulated
A component represents the interfaces that allow the caller to use its functionality, but it does not reveal any internal processes, variables, or state.


* Independent: Independent Components are created with the goal of having as little dependencies as possible on other components.

* Reduced cost

* Ease of development

* Reusable

* Modification of technical complexity

* Reliability
* System maintenance and evolution
* Independent
