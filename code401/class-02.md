# If name equals main

If the interpreter is running a main program that has the module name as its main variable, it sets the special __title__ variable to have a value of __main__.

Every Python module has its own __name__, which indicates that the module is being run as a standalone program. If the script is imported, the name of the module is set to the script/name.
