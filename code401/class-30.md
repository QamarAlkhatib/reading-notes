## What is ES6: 
ES6 is more popularly known as ECMA script, which is a scripting language based on specification and standardization by ECMA international company in ECMA-262 and ISO/IEC 16232. The language was created to standardize Javascript language in order to foster multiple independent implementations. Javascript by far has remained as one of the most well-known implementations of ECMA script and computing since the first standard was published. The other well-known implementations which are published include JScript and ActionScript. ECMA Script is most commonly used as a means to do client-side scripting, specifically in the world wide web. It is increasingly used for writing server-based applications and broader services by making use of node.js.

ES6 refers to the ECMA script programming language and its version 6, which is also a standardized name for JavaScript and is the next version after 5, which was released back in 2011. This language was used to create the standards for Javascripting language such that it can foster multiple independent implementations and was released in June 2015.

## Understanding ES6

ES6 is a client-side scripting language that has been defined by ECMA International. It is quickly becoming one of the most used scripting languages. This language and its specifications regulate languages like JScript, JavaScript, and ActionScript. Support for constants, Block scope, Template literals, expanded parameter handling, extended literals, de-structuring assignment, a newly built-in function for various classes, and so on, all contribute to this. ES6's default parameters are capable of comprehending this. In the signature of the functions, we can immediately put in the default values. Other parameters include template literals in ES6, which are also known as interpolation in other languages and are commonly used to output variables from within a string. The usage of a multi-line string makes it much more appealing, and the use of backticks also helps.

## React:

A JavaScript library for building user interfaces

- Declarative
React makes creating interactive UIs a breeze. Create basic views for each state of your project, and React will update and render the appropriate components as your data changes.
Declarative views improve the predictability and debugability of your code.
Component-Based

- Compose encapsulated components that handle their own state to create complicated user interfaces.
You can simply transmit rich data through your app and keep state off of the DOM because component functionality is written in JavaScript rather than templates.

## what is Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is self-described as a utility first CSS framework. Rather than focusing on the functionality of the item being styled, Tailwind is centered around how it should be displayed. This makes it easier for the developer to test out new styles and change the layout.

## what is Next.js

Next. js is a JavaScript framework 
It lets you build server-side rendering and static web applications using React. also, for developing single page Javascript applications. The benefits of this framework are numerous, both for our clientsâ€™ applications as well as for our development team.
