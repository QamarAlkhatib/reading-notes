# A beginner's guide to Big O Notation

Big O notation is used to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm Also to describe the execution time required or the space used such as in memory or on desk by an algorithm.

We have these notation of Big O:

1. O(1): 
its describe the algorithm that will always be executed in the same time or space regards to the size of the input data.

2. O(N): 
its describe the algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data.

3. O(N^2): 
its describe the algorithm whose performance is directly proportion to the squared size of the input data. it is common with the nested iterations over data.

4. O(2^N):

its describe the algorithm whose growth double with each addition to the input data.
