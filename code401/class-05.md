## Big O: Analysis of Algorithm Efficiency

- Running Time: The amount of time a function needs to complete.(Time complexity)

- Memory space: The amount of memory resource a function uses to store data and instructions. (Space complexity)

- Big O's role in algorithm efficiency is to explain the method's Worst Case efficiency. It focuses on the above-mentioned variables, which we often refer to as Space and Time. In order to investigate these limiting constraints, we should look into four key areas:

  - Input Size
  - Units of Measurement
  - Orders of Growth
  - Best Case, Worst Case, and Average Case

## Linked list

A Linked List is a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other. The most defining feature of a Linked List is that each Node references the next Node in the link.

Types of Linked List are:

- Singly - Singly refers to the number of references the node has. A Singly linked list means that there is only one reference, and the reference points to the Next node in a linked list.

- Doubly - Doubly refers to there being two (double) references within the node. A Doubly linked list means that there is a reference to both the Next and Previous node.
