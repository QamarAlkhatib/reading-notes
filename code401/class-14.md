# Data Visualization


## Matplotlib Tutorial

Matplotlib is a very quick way to visualize data from Python. It provides publication-quality figures in many formats.

## IPython

The IPython shell has lots of interesting features including named inputs and outputs, improved documentation and much more. It allows interactive matplotlib sessions that have Matlab/Mathematica-like functionality.

## pyplot

Most of plotting commands in pyplot have Matlab(TM) analogs with similar arguments. Pyplot is a convenient interface to the matplotlib object-oriented plotting library.

Matplotlib comes with a set of default settings that allow customizing all kinds of properties. While matplotlib defaults are rather good in most cases, you may want to modify some properties for specific cases. You can control the defaults of almost every property in Matplotlib.

## Figures

A figure is the windows in the GUI that has "Figure #" as title. Figures are numbered starting from 1 as opposed to the normal Python way starting from 0. This is clearly MATLAB-style. There are several parameters that determine what the figure looks [this](https://github.com/rougier/matplotlib-tutorial#figures).
