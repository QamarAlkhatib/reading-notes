#### The Growth Mindset is basically the courage to improve, learn and discover new things for Professional or personal purposes. since it is not that only! **Growth mindset is a path to success, productive, creative**. Most successful people that we know as Elon Musk, Bill gates, jeff Bezos, etc.. have a ***Growth mindset*** .

##### Dr. Dweck coined the term "growth mentality" to describe people who believe that through hard work and strong relationships with others they can achieve great things. People with a growth mentality are looking for ways to learn and acquire new skills and improve their existing skills. As we have already mentioned, the growth mentality is an approach to life in which an individual believes that his talents, intelligence and capabilities can be developed. 

##### People with growth thoughts feel that their abilities and intelligence can be improved through effort and perseverance. Students with a growth mentality believe that the ability to change is the result of effort, perseverance, and practice. Because of this growth mentality, students work hard to improve their skills, leading to greater growth and success.

##### Compared to a **fixed mindset**, a growth mentality encourages people to take on challenges, maintain efforts, and try new strategies, both for children and adults. With a Growth Mindset, you can focus on developing your skills and prove how intelligent and talented you are. A positive attitude can be the difference between a student who abandons himself and is not a mathematician, is productive and struggles to achieve growth.
##### When people see the value of challenging themselves they want to learn and grow, and the Buffett formula is a great example of that. People with this mindset do not get discouraged by failure, because they do not see themselves as failures in any situation, but as learners.


#### As *Napoleon Hill* said
> “Strength and growth come only through continuous effort and struggle.”

#### As for me, I always in the morning At 5 AM Tell myself these things:
- [x] "Hey Qamar, Come Up and go hit the GYM. it is your day today." We need Positive Thinking only :weight_lifting_woman:!
- [x] I Remember where I want to be in the future, And to look at *what I can do now* for my goals.
- [x] What I want to Study and reading today, as well as *What I want to achieve today*.
