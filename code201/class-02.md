## Continuing Jon Duckett HTML book:

# Chapter 2 - Text

when creating web pages with HTML, we use tags and these tags for the content of the page know as **markup**.

#### we have Two types of markup:

1. Structural markup: and its the elements that we use to describe both headings and paragraphs. such as < h1-h6>, < p> and superscript < sup > & subscript < sub>. 

2. Semantic markup: and it provides extra information such as where the emphasis is placed in a sentence. such as < strong>, < em>, and < abbr> tags

This chapter is talking about decision-making in a script to determine which line of code should run next, and its components **1. (expression evaluated, and returns a value)** and **2. (conditional statement, and it says what to do in a given situation).**  *in addition* the comparison operators such as **(== ,  !=, ===, <, >)** and logical operators. 

As well as, talk about the **if statements**, and its check if a condition is true, and if it's true the code block will execute. and the **if-else**
and is just like the if statement, but if the condition is not true in the **if** the else if will resolves and run instead of the first **if statement**

```
if(condition){
    //code block
}
else {
    //code block
}
```
