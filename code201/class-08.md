# Chapter 15 - Layout


This chapter talks about layout in css,  and we have many types of layout.
Browsers display pages in normal flow unless we specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning., The **< div>** elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page. Also talks about **float property** and its moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-column 
layouts. (Floated items require a defned width.)
Also, Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts. Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide, and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 
pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling). **Grids** help create professional and flexible designs. And, CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
Finally, we can include multiple CSS files in one page.
