### Based on what I've learned today for Markdown GitHub

### Markdown is a way to style the text on the web using diffrent types of non-alphabetic charachters such as #, *, -. 

##### There are many types of text headers, For Exmple:
# This is the big one.
### This is the meduim one.
###### This is the smallest one. 

#### We can do Some text style As...

**This is a bold text**  Or __Bold text__

*This is the italic text*  Or _italic text_

_we can **do them ** togther_ 

#### You can add a pictuer ðŸ˜†

### And you can write what you want to do as a list:

### Or as an ordered numbers:
1. I want to eat
2. I want to watch a movie tonight
3. I can't wait to finish this ðŸ˜º.

### or not as unordered one as:
* I can't wait..
* No, i think it's FUN
